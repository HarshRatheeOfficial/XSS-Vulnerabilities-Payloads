🔍 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) 

XSS is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into web pages. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, phishing attacks, and malware injection. There are three main types of XSS:

    Stored XSS – The script is permanently stored (e.g., in a database).
    Reflected XSS – The script is embedded in a URL and executed when clicked.
    DOM-Based XSS – The payload is executed by manipulating the page’s JavaScript (client-side attack).
